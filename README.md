# Go Learning To-Do List

This project is a personal Go (Golang) learning exercise designed to help me understand the basics of Go programming. The project focuses on building a task management system where I can track tasks and their subtasks, implementing basic HTTP handling to display tasks, and learning key Go concepts along the way.

The tasks in this project represent different areas of Go that I aim to master, including setting up the Go development environment, learning Go syntax, and building a simple Todo app.

The goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of Go by actively applying what I’ve learned and making incremental improvements.

## Current Features

1. Task List: The main feature is a task list with subtasks that are displayed through an HTTP handler. The task list includes:

- Setting up the Go development environment
- Learning Go syntax and core concepts
- Creating a simple Todo app in Go

2. Task Display: The tasks and their subtasks are displayed when you run the Go program and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

3. Code Structure:

- The project is structured using Go's basic features like structs, arrays, and functions.
- I used HTTP handlers to show the list of tasks.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I learned the following key Go concepts:

- How to structure a basic Go application
- Understanding of Go’s structs, arrays, and slices
- Basic task handling using functions and method receivers
- Setting up an HTTP server in Go to display information
- Using Go's strings.Builder for efficient string concatenation

## Next Steps in Learning Go

- Testing: I need to learn first how to do testing in Neovim.
- Error Handling: I'll work on improving error handling throughout the application, especially in the HTTP handler and other critical areas.
- Concurrency: Learning Go's concurrency model using Goroutines and Channels is a major next step, as Go’s strength lies in handling concurrent processes efficiently.
- Performance Optimization: I will explore how to improve the performance of the Go app, learning more about Go’s memory management and optimization strategies.
- Web Frameworks: I'll dive deeper into building more complex web applications in Go, possibly integrating a web framework like Gin or Echo to handle HTTP requests more efficiently.
- Database Integration: Adding persistent storage by integrating a database (like PostgreSQL or SQLite) to store tasks and subtasks will be a crucial next step.
- Deployment: Once the app is more robust, I'll deploy it on a platform such as Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
